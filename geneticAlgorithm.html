		<h1><b>Using a genetic algorithm to evolve artwork</b></h1>
		<div class="contentText">	
		 	<br />
			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			As part of the IN711/Algorithms and Data Structures paper, a practical involved writing a genetic algorithm to mimic a set a of coloured squares (a chromosome).<br />
			I expanded on this idea to allow the application to evolve into user-supplied images of varying sizes.

			<br /><br /><br />
			<h3><b>Process</b></h3>

			The basic flow of the algorithm is:
			<ul type="circle">
				<li>Generate a population of random images</li>
					<ul type="circle">
						<li>While the total Cost of the best image is greater than zero:</li>
						<ul type="circle">
							<li>Compare each member of the population to the target image and store each difference (Cost)</li>
							<li>Arrange the population by lowest cost (closest image accuracy)</li>
							<li>Divide the population at a given spot (usually half-way)</li>
							<li>Randomly select pairs from the "top" half</li>
							<li>Create "child" images by combining sections of the selected pairs</li>
							<li>Overwrite the "bottom" half of the population with the new children</li>
							<li>Randomly mutate specific genes across the population</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<br /><br />
			<h5><b>Some process details</b></h5>

			The application was implemented in C#.<br />
			Images are loaded into an array of Color objects.<br />
			The Cost is calculated as the total absolute difference between the RGB values of each pixel in the image.<br />
			Multiple parameters are set at run-time by the user. For example, the probability of mutation across the population, 
			and how often to draw the image to screen - this values also serves as a trigger to save the current image file to disk.
			
			<br /><br /><br />
			<h4><b>Examples</b></h4>

			The original test image was a 4x4 image comprised of a pattern of 6 colours; black, white, grey, red, blue and a lighter blue:<br />
			
			<div class = "codeText">
			public static Color[] TARGET_DRAW16 = { wh, lb, db, bl,
                                                    gr, re, gr, re,
                                                    re, gr, re, gr,
                                                    bl, db, lb, wh };
			</div>
			
			<br /><br />
			<h5><b>Test simulation results</b></h5>

			The first generation's fittest candidate had a cost of 3825.<br />
			<img src="geneticAlgorithmImg/10_09_2017_13_51_06.109_Gen-1_Cost-3825.bmp" width="256"><br /><br />

			At 600 generations, after 40 milliseconds, the pattern is becoming visible, with a cost of 840.<br />
			<img src="geneticAlgorithmImg/10_09_2017_13_51_06.149_Gen-600_Cost-840.bmp" width="256"><br /><br />

			At 13,000 generations, after around 900 milliseconds, the pattern is clearly visible, with a cost of 366.<br />
			<img src="geneticAlgorithmImg/10_09_2017_13_51_06.935_Gen-13000_Cost-366.bmp" width="256"><br /><br />


			Continuing from this point brings minor improvements over a longer time. At generation 240,000, after around 17 seconds, differences in the shades are only slightly perceptible, with a cost of 94.<br />
			<img src="geneticAlgorithmImg/10_09_2017_13_51_22.920_Gen-240000_Cost-94.bmp" width="256"><br /><br />

			<br /><br />
			<h4><b>Pixel Art</b></h4>

			The idea was that if everything above worked, it should be trivial to apply the above algorithm to any image. <br /><br />

			A 32x32 array comprised of six Colors representing a popular video game character was loaded to test the algorithm with more complex images,
			After some experimentation to find efficient parameters (more on this later) the results were positive.<br /><br />

			This video shows a series of images saved every 200 generations, starting with generation 1 at a cost of 364,452, running to generation 121,200 with a cost of 49,987. 
			The processing time was around 2 minutes and 45 seconds.<br />
			<div class="text-center">

			</div>
			

			At this point it became obvious that hand-coding arrays of Color objects is silly.


			<br /><br />
			<h4><b>Loading User-provided Art</b></h4>

			The application was modified to accept images of the resolutions 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, and 512x512. <br />
			The images are iterated over and each pixel's RGB values is saved into a new target array.<br />
			The application draws onto a canvas of 512x512 and the sizes of pixels required to fill the canvas properly are calculated at run-time.<br /><br />

			After some experimentation, it was found the value of the probability to mutate (prMutate) needs to be lowered as the image resolution and thus the chromosome size, increases.<br />
			For example, for  a population of 16 32x32 images, a good prMutate is 0.01:<br />
			16 * 32 * 32 * 0.01 = 163.84 (164 mutations per generation).<br />
			Or for a population of 16 128x128 images, 0.00004:<br />
			16 * 128 * 128 * 0.0002 = 52.4288 (52 mutations per generation).<br /><br />

			Note: Populations over 16 were not tested thoroughly as the time required for evolving large populations of high resolution images were found to be restrictive.<br /><br />
			
			<br />
			<h5><b>Higher resolution examples</b></h5>
			A 128x128 square section of Ren√© Magritte's 1964 artwork <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Son_of_Man">The Son of Man</a> was chosen as a test image due to subtle 
			shades in dark/grey colours mixed with highly contrasted, bright colours.<br /><br />

			This video shows a series of images saved every 1000 generations, starting with generation 1 at a cost of 3,851,292, running to generation 550,000 with a cost of 694,811. 
			The processing time was around 3 hours, 45 minutes, and 10 seconds.<br />
