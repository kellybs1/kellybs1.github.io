					<h1> Personal story </h1>
					Written per task<br />

					<br />
					<b>Task 1</b>
					<br />
					<b>Multitech mDot programming.</b>
					<br />
					<p>My primary task for the semester was to learn to work with the Multitech mDot node prototyping boards, in both software
						and hardware terms), purchased as part of the of the Multitech IoT Starter kit that was purchased at the end of semester
						1. As I was the team member to suggest these products to the team I felt I should be responsible for what most team
						members consider the most difficult tasks. This was the largest and most difficult task I was assigned, and was completed
						over 6 weeks, including documentation and code improvements, and more comprehensive comments. This will
						be the largest section of my Story.</p>

					<p>As was researched before purchase, we found Multitech provides a large collection of open source C++ libraries to import
						into your own projects, as well as there b eing existing libraries for different hardware and sensors created by the
						community. Multitech also provides some tutorial videos and example code (for example,
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9ixiSduqxo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9ixiSduqxo</a>,
						<a href="https://os.mbed.com/teams/MultiTech/code/mDot_helloworld/">https://os.mbed.com/teams/MultiTech/code/mDot_helloworld</a>).
						<br /> Due to updates in the codebase it was found the libraries used in some of the example programs are no longer fully
						compatible with each other and my first challenge was building a compatible base of libraries that I know are compatible
						with our hardware and will be easy to be built upon in the future. These base libraries are used across the example
						programs found under the "MDot development" section found at
						<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/README.md">
							https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/README.md</a>, which will now be discussed.</p>

					<p>Development for mDot is most easily performed using the online "armMBED" compiler at
						<a href="https://os.mbed.com/">https://os.mbed.com/</a>. The code is written in basic C++ and the compiled binary downloaded and saved to the mDot
						while it is connected to a pc via a Multitech Developer Kit (UDK) (
						<a href="https://www.multitech.com/models/94558010LF">https://www.multitech.com/models/94558010LF</a>).</p>

					<p>All examples provide step by step instructions and wiring diagrams to provide as much ease as possible to team members
						and future project students to re-use and adapt these examples.</p>

					<b>
						<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotHelloWorld/README.md">Example 1: Hello World</a>
					</b>
					<br />
					<p>The first example was building a classic "Hello world" application that communicates with a PC over the serial-to-USB
						interface built into the UDK. It does not necessitate the use of any 3rd party libraries, only the base "mbed.h" library.
						This application keeps an incremented count, outputs the count to the PC via serial, every three seconds. It is a perfect
						test application to test the functionality of the chain of hardware from the mDot, through the UDK, to the PC.
						<br /> This tutorial also includes the initial set up to create and account and an mDot development environment.</p>

					<b>
						<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotAnalogueLDR/README.md">Example 2: Using analogue input</a>
					</b>
					<br />
					<p>This example is the first to read data from an external sensor. It does not necessitate the use of any 3rd party libraries,
						but it does require setting and reading voltage an external input pin. A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) was chosen
						as a good test sensor as LDRs are simple to test, as the sensor reading can be modified by covering the sensor, thus
						lowering the light level. Analogue readings on the mDot read as a "float" between 0-1. This example outputs an average
						of three reading to serial, every second, and is easily adaptable to use other analogue sensors on other pins.</p>

					<b>
						<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotImportingLibrary/README.md">Example 3: Importing 3rd party sensor libraries</a>
					</b>
					<br />
					<p>This is a quick tutorial on how to import a 3rd party library developed for more advanced digital sensors. This is required
						for any sensors that provide more than an analogue voltage reading. Two examples of sensor libraries we have used during
						this project are the DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor library, TSL2560 Lux sensor library, and the Adafruit GPS Breakout
						library. This example uses a community-provided DHT22 library, as future examples and our prototype nodes use this
						sensor.</p>

							<b>
								<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotDigitalandAnalogue/README.md">Example 4: Using an analogue input and a digital input with 3rd party library on an mDot</a>
							</b>
							<br />
							<p>This example is a combination of the analogue and serial output examples, and adds a digital DHT22 sensor. The example
								uses a 3rd party library to output analogue light level, as well as digital temperature and humidity over serial,
								and completes the basic "sensor-reading" examples.</p>

							<b>
								<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotBasicLoRaConnection/README.md">Example 5: Using an mDot to connect to a LoRa network over ABP (Activation by personalisation)</a>
							</b>
							<br />
							<p>This example provides a basic example on connecting to a LoRa network and sending test data repeatedly ("hello word")
								over the network, using the Activation by Personalisation method, as that is the current configured connection type
								used by the Dunedin IoT server. It also provides USB debugging output. At this point it was required to import the Multitech
								libMdot (
								<a href="https://os.mbed.com/users/kellybs1/code/libmDot-mbed5/">https://os.mbed.com/users/kellybs1/code/libmDot-mbed5/</a>) library to gain full access to the LoRa functionality
								of the mDot. This library was not compatible with the original mbed.h and a newer mbed-os version was imported. The
								dot_util (
								<a href="https://os.mbed.com/users/kellybs1/code/mDot_LoRa_Connect_ABPA/file/abf182f4ebdc/inc/dot_util.h">https://os.mbed.com/users/kellybs1/.../dot_util.h</a>) library written by Multitech was also important and modified
								to remove un-used code. The dot_util library automates various connection actions and debugging output, providing
								a layer of abstraction from the base libmDot library, and greatly simplifies the code required to utilise a LoRa network.
								<br /> These libraries and this example build the base for all future LoRa nodes that were built, and is useful for testing
								end-to-end communication is functioning correctly.</p>

							<b>
								<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotSleepExample/README.md">Example 6: Using the sleep function of a Multitech mDot</a>
							</b>
							<br />
							<p>This example uses the in-built Real Time Clock (RTC) of the LoRa mDot to send the mDot into a low power sleep mode.
								As LoRa nodes are generally considered to be very low-power devices that run on batteries, and they may require waits
								of hours or even days between reading and sending data, the sleep function is a vital function on the mDot, so it
								was considered important enough for its own task. Originally the mDot had two sleep functions, but it was found the
								deep-sleep function was using much more power than expected. <a href="https://os.mbed.com/questions/68494/mDot-in-sleep-STOP-mode/#">This function was removed</a>, and the basic sleep function
								was optimised to use as little power while sleeping as possible. This example keeps an incrementing count, and outputs
								that count to serial and sleeps for five seconds. The example illustrates the flow of the program after waking –
								the mDot does not reset RAM or lose data while sleeping, it simply picks up again directly after where it was told
								to sleep – so the count does not reset between sleeps.</p>

							<b>
								<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotLoRaDHT22LDRSleep/README.md">Example 7: Fully functional Node</a>
							</b>
							<br />
							<p>This example combines all previously learned functions in the examples to build a node that senses data, sends it
								over a LoRaWAN, and then sleeps/wakes on a loop. It does not include any new code or libraries, it is effectively
								cut-and pasted code from previous examples to test all functions. Future project members will be able to use this
								code simply by changing the encryption keys, active pin values (which are documented in the pin layout file here:
								<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDot/mdot-pinout-5.png ">https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/.../mdot-pinout-5.png</a>), and changing the digital 3rd party sensor
								libraries from the DHT22 library to whichever library is required.
								<br /> The code is fully commented and can be considered a base project to build any type of node for the Dunedin IoT.</p>

							<b>Reflection</b>
							<br />
							<p>As I was the sole individual and given entire free reign over this aspect, I decided at the beginning that best way
								I could make this task useful to the group would be to learn from absolute basics, up to what is required to meet
								our functional goals, while documenting progress along the way.
								<br /> My major concern was that I would need to be able to provide code and tutorial-level documentation for current and
								future project members to be able to learn what I have learned, in a structured set of steps from Hello Word to Functional
								Node, without having to overcome the obstacles that I encountered while learning.
								<br /> As developing for the mDot required learning to use an unfamiliar development environment (ARMmbed), on an unfamiliar
								platform (mDot and UDK), using a language that I have little experience with (native C++), the task tool significantly
								longer to get to a workable and documentable point that I would have preferred. At times I found that the official
								documentation/code was out-of-date or inaccurate, or targeted towards mDot users in other nations using slightly
								different versions of hardware and software. As official Au/NZ support on the mDot is relatively new (late 2016),
								much of the documentation doesn't mention this support. Generally, I could find solutions to my problems on the Multitech
								or ARMmbed community forums, or in example code provided by other 3rd parties.
								<br /> Overall, I feel I have accomplished my goal successfully and provided future projects members with the ability to
								build upon this base platform for any future node development.</p>
							<br />
							<br />


							<b>Task 2</b>
							</br>
							<b>Building prototype battery powered nodes</b>
							<br />
							<p>Until this point, all previous nodes were developed and tested on the mDot development board (UDK). This requires
								leaving the mDot attached to a PC, and a breadboard with wires and sensors attached to the UDK. This is great for
								in-house testing, but not for real-world simulated testing. For prototyping we purchased a handful of solder-able
								prototyping boards and some <a href="https://www.jaycar.co.nz/arduino-compatible-xbee-interface-shield/p/XC4608">converter boards</a> to 
								convert the pin layout of the mDot to the pin layout supported by the prototyping boards. This allows
								us to have a wire-soldered base node connected to a battery, but with the ability to remove and reprogram the mDot
								as necessary. This is important as we have a limited number of mDots, and they are expensive and time-consuming to
								replace.
								<br /> My major concern when building these nodes was make sure we could supply the mDot with a battery voltage and not
								damage the mDot. After consulting with Otago Polytechnic Embedded lecturer Peter Brooke, we decided upon purchasing
								a <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2843">5V step-down regulator</a> that would be powered by a standard 9V battery.
								<br /> I decided upon building two nodes: One with a DHT22 Temperature/Humidity sensor that I would use for a future assigned
								task, and another with the ability to plug in different analogue sensors as is needed, which makes the board design
								very re-usable by future project members.</br>
								After designing and soldering together the test boards, testing was performed with a multimeter at multiple steps to ensure
								wiring and voltages were correct at each point. Only then were programmed mDots attached for testing.
								<br /> My initial test, which lasted for nearly 7 days, was an analogue temperature sensor sending temperature, and then
								sleeping, every minute on a loop. The battery finally went flat after nearly seven days and 10,000 individual send
								operations. As the sending is the most power-consuming part of LoRa communication, I consider this a successful test.
								In a real-world situation, sending only hourly or even daily, this shows that this very simple configuration could
								have an extended lifetime.
								<br /> The diagrams and testing process are documented here:
								<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotBattery/README.md">https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/.../mDotBattery/README.md</a>
							</p>

							<b>Reflection</b>
							</br>
							<p>For this task my initial and primary concern about damaging the nodes with bad voltages ended up having a very simple,
								although slightly costly, solution. After that the actual design and physical building of the devices went very smoothly,
								and I learned more about the electrical theory side of node development, for which previously I've only had a small
								amount of education, and I find very interesting. I would consider the process relaxing after the drawn-out mental
								challenge of my initial task.
								<br /> I was pleasantly surprised when the first fully-wired node worked on the first attempt. This process was started
								after the correct, required hardware required was ordered, so little external administrative input was required,
								and I did not feel at any time I was waiting on the administrative "OK" to complete any steps in the process. Overall,
								I had to overcome almost zero problems with this task and enjoyed it greatly.</p>
							<br />
							<br />

							<b>Task 3</b>
							</br>
							<b>Building a "Twitter Bot" frost alert system</b>
							</br>
							<p>This task was a personal idea I had for a practical end-user application of the LoRa WAN. The idea being that if a
								smart application running anywhere could subscribe to frequent LoRa temperature updates being transmitted from a
								specific location, it could use an online alert system of some kind the send alerts that frost may be in that area,
								so people could see alerts before attempting to drive in those areas. This idea came to mind because the area around
								Otago Polytechnic is often frosty in winter while other parts of the city are not.
								<br /> To run the script I chose Python as a programming language, due to its ease of use and large community support,
								as well as existing scripts used for other parts of the project were provided by team member Oscar Macdonald that
								showed how to subscribe to our node data on the server.
								<br /> As the alert platform I chose Twitter, as the service is free and very popular, and the service also provides an
								API that is very developer-friendly (
								<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/oauth">https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/oauth</a>) for automated tasks.
								<br /> Additionally, after a short time, I found a community-provided library that simplifies sending Tweets into a few
								lines of code. (
								<a href="https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>). After some trial and error involving base64 encoding
								and data type issues in Python, I was able to build a functional prototype system. Due to the temperature inside
								the project room hover around 21C-24C, the threshold temperature was set much higher than freezing temperature for
								testing, but this is a simple variable in the script that can be changed easily.
								<br /> The code and instructions for this task are available here:
								<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/tree/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotTwitterBot">https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/tree/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotTwitterBot</a>
							</p>


							<b>Reflection</b>
							</br>
							<p>This task in the project was another solo task, but did provide me with some insight into the importance of documentation.
								As Oscar had already written and documented Python scripts that subscribe to node data over MQTT from the server,
								I could port the parts of his code that I required instead of going through the entire learning process again. Due
								to the team's constant documentation of tasks, my task was simplified. I also found it enjoyable to be able to work
								on the software-development side instead of the hardware-side of the project. I also discovered that generally it
								is better to send raw data from the nodes, as it uses less data, and makes the data more accessible for general use.
								I originally sent temperature and humidity, and used string slicing to extract only the temperature. This was inefficient
								as I was sending un-used data, and the Python code was not what I would consider good code. I modified the mDot code
								to only send the temperature value, allowing me to simply the Python script, which led me to what I consider the
								best version of the alert tool. I enjoy writing code in Python due to the simplicity of the structure of Python code, 
							and the great community support provided in forums and 3rd party libraries, therefore I was happy to have to opportunity to
						extend my knowledge of Python further during this task.</p>
							<br />
							<br />


							<b>Task 4</b>
							</br>
							<b>Building a functional low-cost gateway with Raspberry Pi and mCard</b>
							</br>
							<p>This task was a task I attempted in the first semester, but was not able to reach a functioning state and as a result
								did not complete or publish. After our project supervisor, Thomas Laurenson provided me with additional configuration
								information we were able to build a functional gateway using a Raspberry Pi 2 and a USB LoRa mCard that were purchased
								sometime in the past by previous Internet of Things project groups.
								<br /> As I had only partially documented the original attempts, I took that documentation and built upon it, testing as
								I went. I forked my own versions of repositories that worked and copied locations of sources for reference.
								<br /> I also included full set-up instructions for the Raspberry Pi 2, including details on deal with small usability
								and compatibility issues with the initial installation.
								<br /> This documentation was tested successfully and was used to build the previously mentioned hardware into a functional
								secondary gateway device to use while the Multitech Conduit purchased at the end of the first semester was being
								configured by other team members.
								<br /> The process is documented here:
								<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/gateways/raspberryPi2mCardGateway/README.md">https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/gateways/raspberryPi2mCardGateway/README.md</a>
							</p>

							<b>Reflection</b>
							</br>
							<p>Although was only a small task this semester, it shows the importance of keeping documentation of everything, including
								documentation that didn't initially work, as it can be learned from and built upon in the future. This eventuation
								is also useful to the entire project because it means future project members or even individual people will be able
								to build additional gateways for relatively low cost to connect to the Dunedin IoT server.</p>
							<br />
							<br />

							<b>Other notable minor tasks</b>
							</br>
							<p>Compile a small set of links for new team members to introduce themselves to LoRa technology, and hopefully for others
								to add to in the future.
								<br /> Document here:

							</p>

							<p>Write a small application that converts the string format of security keys for LoRaWAN connections to the format required
								by the mDot library, allowing easy copy-paste instead of hand-typing every key. Application and source here:

							<br />


							<b>Overall project reflection</b>
							</br>
							<p>This project would not have been my first choice among the projects had I not been specifically directed to it.
								My primary interest has become software development oriented, with hardware related interested being more towards
								automation and robotics that embedded systems and radio. I was aware of previous group's issues finding any success
								in this, and was sceptical that I would be able to help as much as expected.
								<br /> However, I feel that due to our group's relaxed timeframes for tasks and lack of direct client demands that software
								projects are required to adhere to, that we profited from having the ability to take time to read, study and
								learn about this technology that we had previously had only tangential experience with. Instead of having to build
								products and projects similar to previous assignments in other papers, we were allowed to take the time trying new
								things and failing, and starting again.
								<br /> I feel a major problem that myself and the group as a whole encountered was our failure to comprehensively plan
								for things that would need to be organised ahead of time to keep work progressing and not stall our progress.
								For example, there were multiple times that we did not fully realise the implications of moving our server out of the project room,
								leading to issues like ports being blocked outside of the Polytech network, meaning that we were unable to communicate with our 
								server until these port were unblocked.<br />
								Another issue was our inability to plan for all of the hardware we would require throughout the project, this led to us making multiple
								orders, causing frustration for administrators who are required to place orders for us, and additionally stalling progress on our development tasks.
								<br /> These problems highlight to me the importance of nut jumping to conclusions and making assumptions that things will "just work" when changes are made,
								and that a batter idea would be to formulate a written plan for changes and adhere to that plan.
								<br /> I do enjoy learning to program and build on new platforms, and I think the ability to adapt to learning new technologies,
								often, is incredibly important for any person working across the entire IT industry. But these skills are not entirely
								new to me, as being adaptable and learning are what I consider two of the most useful parts of my personality, in
								general, and they served me well in previous employment. I did not make any great leaps in my programming techniques or make advancements
								in my overall programming skills in this project, although I did gain eperience using and combining unfamiliar IDEs, languages and platforms.								
								<br /> What I feel I've really taken away from this is that I've learned to working in a collaborative team that works
								towards an end-goal, often independently from each other, and finding that when we attempt to consolidate our efforts,
								our project works. I find it personally and professionally satisfying being part of a small group of smart people
								building something new and creative, and I hope to do more of that kind of work in the future, regardless of my role
								in the team.</p>

							<h4>Technical Proficiency</h4><br />
							<p><b>What is the overall quality of your code like?</b></p>
							4/5<br />
							Most of the code I've written for this project is built on existing example and open source code provided by manufacturers, and modified to suit my purposes, and 
						is designed more to do very <a href="https://os.mbed.com/users/kellybs1/code/mDot_helloworld_bk_sleep/file/5fc728e59130/main.cpp">small, specific tasks efficiently.</a> </br>
							The small amount of completely original code I've written is of a high quality, and my programming ability has not been stretched during this project.<br />
							The primary examples of my original code are these two small applications:<br />
							<a href="https://github.com/kellybs1/MDotKeyFormatter">https://github.com/kellybs1/MDotKeyFormatter</a><br />
							<a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/tree/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotTwitterBot">https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/tree/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotTwitterBot</a>

							<br /><br /><br />
					
							<p><b>How well did you follow best practices in development?</b></p>
							4/5<br />
							<a href="https://os.mbed.com/users/kellybs1/code/FrostyBoySensor/">Code was commented</a>, used sensible variable names, and followed SOLID principles where applicable.<br /> 
							Where possible <a href="https://github.com/kellybs1/MDotKeyFormatter/tree/master/KeyFormatter/KeyFormatterForMdot/KeyFormatterTests">unit tests</a> were employed,
							 although most testing of our project required real-word use of the equipment 
							 and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/gh-pages/development/nodes/mDotHelloWorld/mDotDunedinIoTpics/HelloWorld.jpg">studying debug output</a>.

							 <br /><br /><br />
							<p><b>How well did you use appropriate version control?</b></p>
							5/5<br />
							I retained the use of multiple GIT repositories during development, including this github pages, the <a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT">IoT 
								Dunedin Pages repsitory</a>, and also managed version control for the code hosted on the
							 <a href="https://os.mbed.com/users/kellybs1/code/">ARMmbed online compiler</a>, as well as some private personal repositories for testing and creating in-progress documentation.
							 I continue to use branches or duplicates of existing repositories while fixing bugs, until the fixed code is properly tested and ready to be included in the main repository.
							 <br />
							I also forked multiple third-party repostories for future project use (<a href="https://github.com/kellybs1/libmpsse">1</a>, 
							<a href="https://github.com/kellybs1/Low-Power">2</a>, 
							<a href="https://github.com/kellybs1/FabioCuomo-DS3231">3,</a>
							<a href="https://github.com/kellybs1/Adafruit_Sensor">4,</a>
							<a href="https://github.com/kellybs1/Adafruit_TSL2561">5,</a>
							<a href="https://github.com/kellybs1/packet_forwarder">6</a>).

							<br /><br /><br />
							<p><b>To what extent do you think you contributed an equal portion of the overall project?</b></p>
							4/5<br />
							I was the primary source of development for the <a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/tree/gh-pages/development/nodes">nodes</a>, and a major part of development for the
							 <a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/tree/gh-pages/development/gateways">gateways</a> part of the project. I contributed in other small ways such as manager poster creation,
							 and acting as client to another Project group building a hardware database for us to track our hardware.


							 <br /><br /><br />
							<h4>Profressional Proficiency</h4>
							<br />
							<p><b>How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</b></p>
							3/5<br />
							I attended most meetings/scrums, with issues near the end of the first term where I suffered an illness
							 directly followed by a family issue, both of which prevented my attending meetings or Polytech for around 1.5-2 weeks in total. Due to scheduling issues I often 
							 found attending the Thursday meeting inconvenient or difficult.

							 <br /><br /><br />

							<p><b>How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?</b></p>
							3/5<br />
							Most of my assigned work was indepdendent of the other group members, but I believe when communcation was required I was professional, respectful.
							 I communcated directly and efficiently. Generally our group is very active on Slack, and most of us worked physically isolated from each other
							 during the semester. I <a href="img/exampleslack.png">was active</a> in multiple channels in our Slack group.

							<br /><br /><br />
							<p><b>How well did you document your work throughout the project?</b></p>
							5/5<br />
							Documentation was produced during all project tasks and published upon completion of tasks. Examples of documentation can be 
							found <a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/DunedinIoT/blob/gh-pages/development/nodes/README.md">here</a>.<br />
							I documented almost all project work as it was being done, and <a href="img/commits.png">published documentation to our github pages</a> often.

							<br /><br /><br />
							<p><b>How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements?</b></p>
							4/5<br />
							As our group had no official client, we did not have to deal with changing requirements. However, I expect many problems to arise when learning about new technologies such as 
							LoRa, so I treat all problems as another new challenge to overcome, although my ability to plan for possible problems could be improved in the future.
