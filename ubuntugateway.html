Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) LoraMcard - Test gateway

Prep:
In VirtualBox VM manager, install an Ubuntu 14.04 distribution as usual.
Plug Mcard/USB into PC.
Select virtual machine, click settings, click USB, add a USB device filter for FDTI device.

1) Open a terminal and get the Loriot (it's different for every server,
   you'll notice the domain for this is us1.loriot.io because that's where I 
   registered it - you will get 404 errors if the gateway is not registered)

sudo mkdir /lrt
sudo chmod 777 /lrt
cd /lrt
wget http://us1.loriot.io/home/gwsw/loriot-linux-x64-mcard-USB-0-latest.bin -O loriot-gw
chmod +x loriot-gw

-------------

2) You need the 32 bit ftdi drivers to talk to the MCard

sudo apt-get install libftdi1:i386

-------------

3) You need SSL 1.0.2 installed: Supplied by 3rd party repository

openssl version -a
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:0k53d-karl-f830m/openssl
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssl
openssl version -a

------------

4) Download the libmpsse source and compile/install (install instruction in docs folder)

https://github.com/devttys0/libmpsse


sudo apt-get install swig libftdi-dev python-dev

wget https://github.com/devttys0/libmpsse/archive/master.zip -O libmpsse.zip
unzip libmpsse.zip
cd libmpsse-master
cd src
./configure
make
sudo make install


------------

5) Unplug card, power off VM, replug card, and power on VM.
   (I got errors before doing this)


6) Then after reboot

cd /lrt
sudo ./loriot-gw -f


It should work now.
----------------------

Notable problems:
-Without SSL 1.0.2 there will be an error.
-Without install the i386 (32 bit) FTDI drivers there wiill be an error message about a missing .so file.
-Gateway terminal will log 404 errors if gateway MAC is not registered with Loriot. This is probably by design.
-There was an error message and LIBMPSSE code saying "you could be running an incompatible version of the binary"
after installing another LIBMPSSE version. That version was replaced with the version above and after restarting 
the hardware the gateway was actively.
